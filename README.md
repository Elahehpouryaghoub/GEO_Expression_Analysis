# Gene-Expression and Regulatory Analysis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia(AML) Using R and Microarray Data
This project analyzes microarray gene expression data in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) using R. Differential expression analysis identifies genes altered in AML compared to healthy samples. Functional enrichment highlights key pathways and transcription factors involved in AML-related immune and inflammatory responses.
